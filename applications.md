# Autonomous Robotic System Overview

Q1) Then describe how these sensors could be used in an autonomous robotic system. Be sure to properly use ALL of the terms listed in this document in your responses.
A1) Alright first off what's an autonomous robot you might ask well basically its an independent machine that does not take orders from anyone else and works for themselves. Which then how do the 4 sensors aid the robot throughout the potential missions it must complete, first off active sensors which indicate certain changes within the environment that the transmitter will pick and send the signal bank to said machine. Which helps the robot by telling it what’s happening around them if it's dangerous or not on coming objects approaching or even when it falls over that sort of deal, even where it must head to.

Terms:
Active Sensors: An active sensor is one which transmits a signal into the environment and then measures the response that comes back.

Passive Sensors: A passive sensor is one which just ‘listens’ to what is happening.

Proprioceptive Sensors: A proprioceptive sensor measures values internal to the system (robot).

Exteroceptive Sensors: An Exteroceptive sensor acquires information from the robot’s environment.
