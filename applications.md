# :robot: Autonomous Robotic System Overview

Q1) Then describe how these sensors could be used in an autonomous robotic system. Be sure to properly use ALL of the terms listed in this document in your responses.

A1) Alright first off what's an autonomous robot you might ask well basically its an independent machine that does not take orders from anyone else and works for themselves. Which then how do the 4 sensors aid the robot throughout the potential missions it must complete, first off active sensors which indicate certain changes within the environment that the transmitter will pick and send the signal bank to said machine. Which helps the robot by telling it what’s happening around them if it's dangerous or not on coming objects approaching or even when it falls over that sort of deal, even where it must head to. Next up is passive sensor unlike active sensors which for those it makes the robot react towards a certain condition, for manly passive sensors it just lets the robot listen now sure this is still handy for having the robot identify their surrounding which helps notify the robot what the thing is, but no need to interact with something not important, or at least hint the robot to acknowledging the surroundings if needed to get the active sensors ready. Next up proprioceptive sensors now why would a machine need this? Well to monitor how much of its system is doing like not putting itself through too much power or doing something that will damage itself from its integrity. However a more useful point is to know how to move its robotic limbs, and why plus an easy way to navigate how far it needs to move and collect before it's done with a task, kind of like a tracker of its state of that sort. Lastly exteroceptive sensors rather than having data on the robot itself the can now take into account the environment statistics as well which is useful to know when something is too hot or cold to be in or use it a useful source for well temperature related task, light as well can be measured to see clearly (unless it has night vision then screw me), and of course sound to notify what the noise it to check it out or stay away from. Which yeah those are the pros of having an autonomous robot have these sensors into its system.
