Atuoonomus Robotic System Overview

Q1) Then describe how these sensors could be used in an autonomous robotic system. Be sure to properly use ALL of the terms listed in this document in your responses.

Terms:
Active Sensors: An active sensor is one which transmits a signal into the environment and then measures the response that comes back.

Passive Sensors: A passive sensor is one which just ‘listens’ to what is happening.

Proprioceptive Sensors: A proprioceptive sensor measures values internal to the system (robot).

Exteroceptive Sensors: An Exteroceptive sensor acquires information from the robot’s environment.
