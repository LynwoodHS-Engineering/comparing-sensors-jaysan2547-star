Sensor types responses!

Q1) What is the actual physical process that is allowing the Raspberry Pi to sense the environmnet?
A1) Well within the raspberry Pi will have a python3 program connected to the bread-board that has two different types of sensors being the limit switch & Ultrasonic sound. 
Which then we have the two objects set up to have the world around them get interacted with them. Such as something hitting the lever to send a single to the Raspberry Pi, & the distance on what an object is
towards the ultrasonic sonar to then estimate within the Raspberry Pi.

Q2) What are some environmental factors that might influence the performance of these sensors?
A2) Well I would say this for the lever attachment the purpose is more of a command the Raspberry Pi will only receive if something hits that lever, but it could be use a shut down tool so if some random wind storm
throws some projectiles at lever it could interrupt the process (which is unlikly). However for the ultrasonic item yeah a sand, or winter storm could effect how far the sonar can calibrate due to the endless dust
blocking or even getting inside the sonar will make it hard to tell how far something is.
